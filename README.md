# google-api-address-search

Hello dear friend, if you want to search for a location on the map on your website or project without connecting to maps.google.com and easily learn the latitude and longitude, the script I wrote can be useful.

Demo: http://cemtaner.com/github-google-api/

How is it set up?

Step 1: Create a Google api and get an api key,
Some permissions are required. These;
Places API,
Maps JavaScript API,
Directions API,
Roads API,
Distance Matrix API,

... and it works fine now. Otherwise, you should ask me.

Thanks..
